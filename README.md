# VizWiz_Dataset_Analysis
This repository is part of the codes for our paper 


## 1. Download raw dataset files
Due to the maximum file size limitation of GitHub, not all of the dataset files needed are included.
*Download captions_train2017.json, captions_val2017.json, and instances_train2017.json on http://cocodataset.org/#download. Put the first two files at annotations/MSCOCO, and put the last file at annotations/Objects.
*Download train_places205.csv and val_places205.csv on http://data.csail.mit.edu/places/places205/trainvalsplit_places205.tar.gz. Put them at annotations/Scenes.
